# SuperDiffuse Change Log

## Known issues
* Moving control faders (MIDI) while a piece is loading will lock the interface, forcing a restart of SuperDiffuse. This appears to be a SuperCollider/Qt issue that can't really be addressed 

## Version 1.3.0

* Added configurable input (pre-routing matrix) and output (post-routing matrix) filters

## Version 1.2.0

* Changed faders to behave uniformly (regardless of control from MIDI, OSC or GUI)
* Added GPLv3 license

## Version 1.1.1

* Minor patch to fix issues with machine specific keyboard shortcuts (now uses Qt keycodes)

## Version 1.1.0

* First public release. Thanks to Adrian Moore, Adam Stanovic, Jonty Harrison, Denis Smalley, and the composers at USSS for their support and invaluable thoughts
